## Description

This "mod" changes several of the names and descriptions of enemies, items, locations, etc. to what they maybe, probably should be.

## Wait... so what does it do?

Exactly what I said it does in the description.

## Should I even use this?

Maybe? Probably not. IDK. I threw this on here to make it easier for my friends to install when we play modded. Given that context, there are a lot of inside jokes and other stupid names/descriptions that likely wont make sense to the uninitated. If something is broken or wrong with it, then I likely will **NOT** care and will **NOT** fix it unless: A) **I** notice it *and* B) It bothers **ME**.

~~Use at your own peril.~~
